Hello, I am a practicing malware analyst and reverse engineer, using this blog to showcase the malware samples I have analyzed. Some samples will be well documented but I will be going over them my self.

Other samples are just not well known and less documented, which are the ones I really want to look at. I have around 1 year of experience in this field so I am still actively learning. I hope you enjoy my content and my journey as I hope to become a great reverse engineer and learn all the secrets of malware and computer science along the way.
